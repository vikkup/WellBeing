# WellBeing
WellBeing is a mental health management app. This project was made for the Capstone course at Merrimack College.

WellBeing was created for the Capstone course, the final project a student undertakes before graduation. The app and all assets were created by 
Vikku Ponnaganti, Brian Boyle, and Kevin Sampson while all mental health concepts and information were created by Professor Ray LaVoie of the Girard 
School of Business and his remote team from University of Manitoba. 

The app has many features designed to gauge the mental health of someone and to act upon it through the use of tried and tested methods of improving said
health.

The application was written in Swift and the backend was hosted on Google Firebase.
